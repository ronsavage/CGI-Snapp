Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Snapp.

1.04  Fri Dec 14 16:38:00 2012
	- Unreleased
	- Change sub log():
		From: $myself -> logger -> $level($s) if ($myself && $myself -> logger)
		To:   $myself -> logger -> log(level => $level, message => $s) if ($myself && $myself -> logger)
		The reason for this is that if your code which sub-classes CGI::Snapp is also derived from another
		class or role, that class or role had to provide not just the log() method, but all of debug(),
		info(), notice(), warning(), warn(), error(), err(), critical(), crit(), alert(), emergency()
		and emerg(), just in case any of them are needed.
		I should not have used that design, because it forces other code to provide too much complexity.

1.03  Sat Nov 17 10:31:00 2012
	- Use File::Spec -> catfile('t', 'x.pl') instead of 't/x.pl' in tests.
		This should solve RT#81241 reported by CHORNY under MS Windows.

	- Add CGI::PSGI to the pre-reqs (Andreas Koenig).
	- Change (in Build.PL) configure_requires{Module::Build} from 0.3800 to 0, after adapting advice from
		 Andreas Koenig.
	- Roll the source of CGI::Snapp::Plugin::Forward into CGI::Snapp.
		See also t/forward.t and t/lib/CGI/Snapp/ForwardTest.pm.
		Update docs.
