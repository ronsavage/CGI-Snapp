[V 1.05]

[V 1.04]
Date=2013-06-12T16:38:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Rename CHANGES to Changes as per CPAN::Changes::Spec.
- Add a test of add_header() to t/headers.pl.
- Update corresponding test count in t/test.t.
- Change sub log():
From: $myself -> logger -> $level($s) if ($myself && $myself -> logger)
To: $myself -> logger -> log($level => $s) if ($myself && $myself -> logger)
The reason for this is that if your logger is derived from another class or role, that class
or role had to provide not just the log() method, but all of debug(), info(), notice(), warning(),
warn(), error(), err(), critical(), crit(), alert(), emergency() and emerg(), just in case any
of them are needed.
I should not have used that design, because it forces other code to provide too much complexity.
- Update licence to perl_5. See https://metacpan.org/module/CPAN::Meta::Spec.
- Add a note to the POD for header_type(), about the HTTP status being set to 200 when the header type
has been set to 'none'.
- Add a note to the FAQ about explicitly outputting a header when using Ajax (at least with jQuery).

- Use File::Spec -> catfile('t', 'x.pl') instead of 't/x.pl' in tests.
This should solve RT#81241 reported by CHORNY under MS Windows.
