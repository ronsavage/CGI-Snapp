- Unreleased
- Change sub log():
From: $myself -> logger -> $level($s) if ($myself && $myself -> logger)
To: $myself -> logger -> log($level => $s) if ($myself && $myself -> logger)
The reason for this is that if your code which sub-classes CGI::Snapp is also derived from another
class or role, that class or role had to provide not just the log() method, but all of debug(),
info(), notice(), warning(), warn(), error(), err(), critical(), crit(), alert(), emergency()
and emerg(), just in case any of them are needed.
I should not have used that design, because it forces other code to provide too much complexity.
