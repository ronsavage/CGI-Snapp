Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Snapp.

1.07  Wed Aug 28 14:30:00 2013
	- t/test.t: Clean up usage of arrayref 'v' array, to make test more reliable.
		Thanx to Alexandr Ciornii. See RT#81241.
	- t/params.pl: Sort all hashes (yes, keys and values) and arrays to make comparisons more reliable
		in the presence of hash key randomization, even with Test::Deep's cmp_deeply.
		This has been causing ocassional test failues for CPAN testers.
		Thanx to Andreas Koenig.

1.06  Tue Aug 20 12:30:00 2013
	- Switch from Test::More.is_deeply() to Test::Deep.cmp_deeply().
		This is to avoid hash key randomization issues.

1.05  Thu Jun 13 12:44:00 2013
	- Patch t/test.t so that when Test::Pod is not installed, we expect 0 test results from t/pod.t.

1.04  Wed Jun 12 16:38:00 2013
	- Rename CHANGES to Changes as per CPAN::Changes::Spec.
	- Add a test of add_header() to t/headers.pl.
	- Update corresponding test count in t/test.t.
	- Change sub log():
		From: $myself -> logger -> $level($s)        if ($myself && $myself -> logger)
		To:   $myself -> logger -> log($level => $s) if ($myself && $myself -> logger)
		The reason for this is that if your logger is derived from another class or role, that class
		or role had to provide not just the log() method, but all of debug(), info(), notice(), warning(),
		warn(), error(), err(), critical(), crit(), alert(), emergency() and emerg(), just in case any
		of them are needed.
		I should not have used that design, because it forces other code to provide too much complexity.
	- Update licence to perl_5. See https://metacpan.org/module/CPAN::Meta::Spec.
	- Add a note to the POD for header_type(), about the HTTP status being set to 200 when the header type
		has been set to 'none'.
	- Add a note to the FAQ about explicitly outputting a header when using Ajax (at least with jQuery).

1.03  Sat Nov 17 10:31:00 2012
	- Use File::Spec -> catfile('t', 'x.pl') instead of 't/x.pl' in tests.
		This should solve RT#81241 reported by CHORNY under MS Windows.

1.02  Mon Sep 17 11:38:00 2012
	- Add CGI::PSGI to the pre-reqs (Andreas Koenig).
	- Change (in Build.PL) configure_requires{Module::Build} from 0.3800 to 0, after adapting advice from
		 Andreas Koenig.
	- Roll the source of CGI::Snapp::Plugin::Forward into CGI::Snapp.
		See also t/forward.t and t/lib/CGI/Snapp/ForwardTest.pm.
		Update docs.
	- Roll the source of CGI::Snapp::Plugin::Redirect into CGI::Snapp.
		See also t/redirect.t and t/lib/CGI/Snapp/RedirectTest.pm.
		Update docs.

1.01  Sun Apr  8 10:40:00 2012
	- Shift some code from run() into _determine_(cgi|psgi)_output().
	- Add PSGI-specific code, sub as_psgi(), and make some changes to run() using $self -> _psgi().
	- Add t/psgi.basic.pl.
	- Also test via CGI::Snapp::Dispatch's t/psgi.args.t.

1.00  Mon Feb 27 10:09:44 2012
